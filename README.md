# Modal-Analysis-of-beams-in-MATLAB


• Plotted mode shapes of undamped and free vibrating cantilever, simply-supported and fixed beams.
• Also simulated damage by reducing flexural rigidity, and compared eigenvalues, eigenvectors and mode
shapes w.r.t the baseline model, i.e., the undamaged beams.
